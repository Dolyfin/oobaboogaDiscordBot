# Features
Note: Still very in WIP and will break as I make commits.  

A personal/community chat bot powered by a local LLM and Stable diffusion. The bot can have a customized personality config and send images.  
Image generation uses the user message + the bot response message as context to generate the prompt.  
Now supports voice generation when chatting though text.  

To trigger image generation, user needs to send 1 word from first then second list:  
(send|draw|show|display|generate|give)  
(image|picture|photo|drawing|art|artwork)  
# Getting Started

Alternativly clone the repo which may be broken:
1. ```git clone https://github.com/Dolyfin/LocalDiscordAIChatBot```
2. Run ```startbot.bat```
3. Add discord bot token, API address and port into ```.env``` file.
4. Run ```startbot.bat``` again.
5. Use ```/editconfig chat_channel [channel id here]``` to select a chat channel.

### Custom personas
Copy ```persona/example.json``` template.
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "system_message": "Current time: {{time}}, {{date}}.\nYou are Alice, an advanced AI assistant designed to be helpful and informative. Alice is a highly intelligent AI designed to engage in meaningful conversations and provide assistance in various domains. Alice has a sub system that automatically sends images.\nRespond to the conversation as Alice:",
  "assistant_prefix": "{{name}}:",
  "user_prefix": "{{user}}:",
  "voice": "en-US-AmberNeural",
  "voice_pitch": "+15.0%"
}

```
Create new ```persona_name.json``` in ```persona/``` folder.  
### Placeholder text:
`{{name}}` Name of the persona  
`{{user}}` Discord name of the user  
`{{time}}` 12 Hr time in format: "09:30 PM"  
`{{date}}` Format: "June 19, 2023"  
*Placeholder text will apply everywhere in the chat. Including user messages and bot replies, not just in the prompt.  

# Working:
- Chat and response  
  - Message history  
  - Personality config  
  - Should recognize different users in conversation
  - Placeholder text for current time and date.
- Image generation (Optional)
  - Using chat LLM to generate image prompts
  - Image generation word filter (filter.txt)
- Text to speech (Optional)
  - Using non local MS Azure Speech as protype.
  - The local ones aren't good enough yet or fast enough. 
# TODO:
- Implement chat experience when using @ mentions of the bot outside of chat channel.
- Fallback TTS Voice generation without Azure. Using system tts api.
- Speech to text (Whisper?)
- Optional openai api
- Message grouping. Waiting x seconds to respond to all messages in that time instead of every message.
- Casual conversation. A smart way to intergrate the bot to join and chat when prompted. (Need to figure out how to do this well)
- Macos support. I just got a macbook.
- More stuff I didnt write down  

# Tips
Models like WizardLM or models using the Vinuca 1.1 style seems best for chat generation. I had originally used `TheBloke/WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GPTQ`4bit with good success with the included example.json persona.  
Tested models that should work: `WizardLM-7B-uncensored` `WizardLM-7B-V1.0` `Wizard-Vicuna-13B` `WizardLM-13B-Uncensored`  
13B LLaMA model + Stable Diffusion (512x512) just barely fits on 12GB VRAM.  
7B: 9.5 tokens/s  
13B 5.5 tokens/s   
*Since exllamaa speed has been 2x+ faster.
