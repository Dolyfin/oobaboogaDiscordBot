# oobaboogaDiscordBot
# WIP Description needs updates. This is a modified version from a previous project: https://github.com/Dolyfin/LocalDiscordAIChatBot

Uses API from oobabooga and AllTalk extension for speech.

This bot was build with TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GPTQ in mind, as it follow the chat format well.

TODO:
Multi user handling. There is no stop token when multiple users starts chatting and the LLM attemps to add lines from a previous user in the chat history.
